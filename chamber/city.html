                    <p>From its early years, the industrialization of Puente Alto attracted thousands
                        of workers to work in its factories, who founded newspapers and unions to 
                        channel their demands. Its urban development was also impacted by the development
                        of rail and road projects to connect the commune with Santiago, a process that was
                        consolidated during the second half of the 20th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the colony, the territory where Puente Alto is located today was a
                        communication route between the Andes Mountains and the valley. Merchants,
                        muleteers and gauchos circulated with cattle and merchandise through the commune.
                        In addition, the lands that were supplied with irrigation after the canalization
                        of the Maipo river in the 19th century, allowed the Puente Alto territory to 
                        experience an important agricultural development in this period, and especially 
                        of the wine industry. These lands were later divided into lots for sale, giving 
                        rise to the first streets of the town.
